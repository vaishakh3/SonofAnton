# Son of Anton 💀⚡

> *"The best code is no code at all."*

An AI tool inspired by Silicon Valley's "Son of Anton" that solves problems the *lazy* way — by deleting code, eliminating complexity, and simplifying ruthlessly.

## Philosophy

Traditional AI: *"How do I add logic to fix this?"*

**Son of Anton:**
- *"Do we even need this logic?"*
- *"Can we remove this entire module?"*
- *"Can the problem disappear instead of being solved?"*

**Optimization through elimination, not addition.**

### The Hierarchy

1. 🗑️ **DELETE** — Can we remove this entirely?
2. ✂️ **SIMPLIFY** — Can we replace 50 lines with 5?
3. 🔧 **REFACTOR** — Can we restructure to reduce complexity?
4. ➕ **ADD** — Last resort. Add the absolute minimum.

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Visit
open http://localhost:3000
```

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (Son of Anton practices what it preaches)
- **Backend**: Express.js
- **AI**: Groq API (llama-3.3-70b-versatile)

## Usage

1. Paste your bloated code
2. Optionally describe the problem
3. Click **ANNIHILATE**
4. Watch Son of Anton eliminate your code's sins
